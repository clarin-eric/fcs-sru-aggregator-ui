The search engine connects to the local data collections that are available in the centres. The data itself stays at the centre where it is hosted â€“ which is why the underlying technique is called <1>federated content search</1>.</0><1>To learn more about the FCS, please visit the page <2><1>Content Search</1> at CLARIN.eu</2>.</1>",
